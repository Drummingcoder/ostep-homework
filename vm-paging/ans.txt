1. The page table size as the address space grows should be larger to accommodate bigger 
and more addresses. More pages would be needed to fill in the address space, so the page
table must grow. As the page size increases, the page table would grow smaller because
the pages would take up more space and leave less space for other pages, so there would be
less entries in the table.

// Observations appear correct

2. As you increase the number of pages available, more and more addresses become valid and
more memory can be accessed.

3. The third one is too unrealistic because the small size of the page size compared to the large
address space generates a large page table that's hard to keep track of.

4. If the address space is larger than the physical memory size, the program errors out. Same if 
the address space isn't a multiple of the page size (or larger than the address space, for that matter).
