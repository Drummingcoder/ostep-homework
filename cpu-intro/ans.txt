 CPU utilization would be 100% or 10 because there are two processes that constantly need the CPU to run.

  It takes 7 to complete both processes.
  Wrong, correct answer was 11:

  It only takes 7 because the CPU process (1) runs during the I/O get (0), so it runs faster.

  4. It will take 11 steps because the CPU process waits for the I/O to finish.

The IO waits until the other two processes are done to begin running again,
which isn't efficient because the IO can run while the CPU is, but it doesn't.

7. The IO can run immediately, allowing it to run IO while the CPU is running
and therefore becoming more efficient.
